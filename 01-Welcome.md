# Data Structure Tutorial
Welcome to a tutorial on Python data structures. This tutorial will go over the following data structures:

- [Queues](https://github.com/reaganhsmith/CSE212/blob/main/02-Queues.md)
- [Sets](https://github.com/reaganhsmith/CSE212/blob/main/03-Sets.md)
- [Trees](https://github.com/reaganhsmith/CSE212/blob/main/04-Trees.md)


Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
