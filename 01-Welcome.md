# Data Structure Tutorial
Welcome to a tutorial on Python data structures. This tutorial will go over the following data structures:

- Queues 
- Sets
- Trees


Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
