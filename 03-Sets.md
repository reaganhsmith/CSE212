# Data Structure: **SETS**
## Introduction 
Sets are useful in python data structure because they can store multiple things in a variable. Sets contain undordered, unchangable and unidexed collections. Like other things in python, sets do not worry about the order of the data. Order is not important in sets. 
Sets are written using curly brackets like this: 
```python
fruit_set = {"apples","mangos","pineapple"};
```
Because sets are unordered there is no sure way to know how the items will appear. 
Set items are unchangable. This means you cannot change items in the set. However you can add or remove items to it. 
Another thing about sets is that they do not allow duplicates. So for a set like: 
```python
fruit_set = {"apples","mangos","pineapple", "mangos"};
print(fruit_set);
```
When the set gets printed it will look like: {'apples','mangos','pineapple'}
