# Data Structure: **TREES**
## Introduction
**Trees** are a collection of multiple nodes. They are non-linear data structures that are similar to linked lists. Trees connect to several different nodes. There are three types of trees: binary trees, binary search trees and balanced binary search trees. 
## Types of trees 
### Binary Trees
Binary Tree Data structures are a structure where each node has at max two children. The top node is called the root node and the two children are referred to as the left child and the right child. Nodes that are not connected to other nodes are leaf nodes. There will always be one root node.

### Binary Search Trees
Binary Search Trees (BST) are useful because they allow the user to keep a list of numbers that are sorted. It sorts and places data by comparing the data with the values of the parent nodes. Each node in this tree can have a max of 2 children nodes. Just like binary trees, these are called the left child and right child. The data less than the parent is placed to the left (left child) and the data that is greater than the parent node gets added to the right (right child). BST can find an element that is present in O(n) worst-case time. This means that when searching for an item in the BTS with worst-case scenario, it will take O(n) time.
